# JetNotes

JetNotes is a sample project still in progress that presents modern, 2022 approach to Android application development using Kotlin and latest tech-stack.
The goal of the project is to demonstrate best practices, provide a set of guidelines, and present modern Android application architecture that is modular, scalable, maintainable and testable.
This application may look simple, but it has all of these small details that will set the rock-solid foundation of the larger app suitable for bigger teams and long application lifecycle management.
